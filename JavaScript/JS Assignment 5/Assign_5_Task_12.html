        a. Generate Random number between 1 to 100
        b. Ask user to guess number

        d. If user guess right on first, second or third try is should say “You are right, You won”
        e. Then it asks the user if he/she wants to play again, if user says yes, then the whole process starts from point (a) again
        f. If user says no then game end saying “Thank you for playing with use today”

        say yes then it should start from point (a) again.
        Note: You must use while or do while loop and functions for this game */
